# CRA Default

Personal CRA setup with default settings. Module imports (for both tests and the actual source code), typescript, styled-components with `ThemeProvider` readied.

Planning to expand on `theme.js` in the future to include more standardized styling options. Makes UI design much more consistent that way.

Still a work in progress but feel free to clone for your own projects, I guess. Idk your life not mine.
